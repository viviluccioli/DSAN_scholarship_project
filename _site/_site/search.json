At a greater scale, they hurt innocent civilians.\n\n\n\n\nLimited resources have long prevented global organizations from fully capturing the truth behind attacks on humanitarian missions.\n\n\nBut behind every missing detail is a missed opportunity to prepare, to protect, to prevent.\n\n\nTo minimize the harm, we must uncover the patterns hidden in the dataâ€”and come together, as a global force, to turn insight into action."
